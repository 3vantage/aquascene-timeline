```

#### 2. Run All Tests
```bash
# Run the complete test suite
npm run test:all

# Or run individual test categories
npm run test:visual        # Screenshots and visual regression
npm run test:interaction   # Form submission and UX flows
npm run test:performance   # Core Web Vitals and loading speed
npm run test:mobile        # Mobile responsiveness and touch

# Open detailed HTML report
npm run test:report

# Screenshots and artifacts saved in:
# test-results/
```

## 📊 Current Test Results

### Status: 🔴 Critical Issues Detected
The comprehensive analysis revealed that the application is currently experiencing routing issues that prevent proper functionality testing. See `TEST-REPORT.md` for full details.

### Key Findings:
- ❌ **Routing Problems**: All language routes return 404 errors
- ❌ **Missing Functionality**: Forms and interactions not accessible
- ✅ **Fast Loading**: 404 page loads quickly (~1.1s)
- ⚠️ **Configuration Issues**: Next.js i18n setup needs fixing

## 🔧 Test Configuration

### Playwright Config (`playwright.config.js`)
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Devices**: Desktop and mobile viewports
- **Reports**: HTML, JSON, JUnit formats
- **Screenshots**: On failure + full visual testing
- **Traces**: Debug information for failed tests

### Environment Setup
- **Base URL**: Automatically detects localhost:3000 or :3004
- **Timeout**: 30s per test, 10s per action
- **Retries**: 2 retries on CI, 0 locally
- **Parallel**: Full parallel execution

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "No tests found"
```bash
# Check test file naming (must end in .spec.js or be in testDir)
ls tests/*.js

# Verify playwright config
npx playwright test --list
```

#### 2. "Dev server not running"
```bash
# Start development server first
npm run dev

# Check if server is responding
curl http://localhost:3000
```

#### 3. "Tests failing due to 404"
This is a known issue. The current application has routing configuration problems that prevent the main content from loading. See `TEST-REPORT.md` for full analysis and recommendations.

#### 4. "Browser download failed"
```bash
# Install playwright browsers
npx playwright install
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run tests with browser visible
npm run test:headed

# Run with debugger
npm run test:debug

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/working-test.spec.js --headed
```

## 📈 Using Test Results

### For Development
1. **Fix Critical Issues**: Address 404 errors and routing problems first
2. **Visual Improvements**: Use screenshots to compare before/after changes
3. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor Core Web Vitals improvements
4. **Accessibility**: Use compliance reports to fix a11y issues

### For Stakeholders
1. **Current State Evidence**: Screenshots show the "lackluster" appearance
2. **Technical Analysis**: Detailed report explains why issues exist
3. **Improvement Roadmap**: Clear priorities for fixing problems
4. **Progress Tracking**: Re-run tests to measure improvements

## 🔄 Continuous Testing

### Git Hooks (Recommended)
```bash
# Add to .husky/pre-commit
npm run test:performance
npm run test:accessibility
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# GitHub Actions / CI environment
npm run test:all -- --reporter=junit
```
