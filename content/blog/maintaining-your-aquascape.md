# Maintaining Your Aquascape: Complete Weekly and Monthly Maintenance Guide

A beautiful aquascape is not a "set it and forget it" creation. Like any living artwork, it requires consistent care, attention, and understanding of its evolving needs. Proper maintenance keeps your underwater landscape healthy, vibrant, and continuously improving over time.

This comprehensive guide provides structured maintenance routines that will help you develop consistent habits while addressing the specific needs of planted aquariums. Whether you're managing your first aquascape or refining your established routines, these practices will ensure long-term success.

## Understanding Aquascape Maintenance Philosophy

### The Living Ecosystem Approach

Unlike traditional aquariums focused primarily on fish health, aquascapes require balancing the needs of plants, fish, beneficial bacteria, and the overall aesthetic vision. This complex ecosystem demands regular monitoring and adjustments to maintain optimal conditions for all inhabitants.

### Preventive vs. Reactive Maintenance

Successful aquascape maintenance emphasizes prevention over reaction. Regular small adjustments prevent major problems, while consistent routines maintain the delicate balance that keeps aquascapes thriving.

### Seasonal Considerations

Bulgarian water conditions change seasonally, affecting your aquascape's needs. Summer heat may increase algae growth, while winter heating systems can alter humidity and evaporation rates. Adapt your maintenance routines accordingly.

## Daily Observation and Quick Tasks (5-10 minutes)

### Visual Health Assessment

Start each day with a 2-minute visual inspection:

**Plant Health Indicators:**
- New growth patterns and coloration
- Signs of nutrient deficiency (yellowing, holes, stunted growth)
- Plant positioning and growth direction
- Any visible plant damage or decay

**Water Quality Visual Cues:**
- Water clarity and color
- Surface film or foam formation
- Algae growth on glass or hardscape
- Equipment operation status (filters, lights, CO2)

**Fish and Invertebrate Behavior:**
- Normal swimming patterns and feeding behavior
- Signs of stress or disease
- Interaction with plants and environment

### Quick Daily Tasks

**Temperature and Equipment Check:**
- Verify heater and filter operation
- Check CO2 system pressure and bubble rate
- Ensure lights are functioning properly

**Feeding and Immediate Care:**
- Feed fish appropriate amounts (avoid overfeeding)
- Remove any visible dead plant material
- Check for equipment malfunctions

**Photo Documentation:**
- Take daily progress photos for long-term tracking
- Document any issues for future reference

## Weekly Maintenance Routine (1-2 hours)

### Water Management

**Water Changes (30-50% weekly):**

The cornerstone of aquascape maintenance, regular water changes remove accumulated nutrients, replenish trace elements, and maintain stable water chemistry.

**Preparation Steps:**
1. Prepare aged water 24 hours in advance when possible
2. Match temperature to tank water (22-26Â°C typically)
3. Add water conditioner to neutralize chlorine and chloramines
4. Test water parameters before and after changes

**Water Change Process:**
1. Turn off CO2 and electrical equipment
2. Use gravel vacuum to remove detritus from substrate
3. Trim plants before water change for easier access
4. Remove water slowly to avoid disturbing substrate
5. Refill gradually to prevent plant shock
6. Restart equipment and check all systems

### Plant Care and Pruning

**Systematic Pruning Approach:**

**Foreground Plants:**
- Trim carpet plants to maintain uniform height (2-4cm typically)
- Remove runners that extend beyond desired boundaries
- Replant healthy trimmings to fill sparse areas
- Use sharp scissors for clean cuts that heal quickly

**Midground Management:**
- Prune stem plants by cutting above nodes for regrowth
- Remove lower leaves that show signs of deterioration
- Maintain plant proportions relative to hardscape elements
- Create natural-looking shapes avoiding geometric lines

**Background Plants:**
- Top stem plants to encourage bushy growth
- Remove excessive growth that blocks light from foreground plants
- Maintain clear sight lines through the aquascape
- Create varied heights for natural appearance

**Dead Material Removal:**
- Remove all yellowing, brown, or decaying plant matter immediately
- Clean plant bases of accumulated debris
- Trim damaged roots during plant maintenance

### Algae Management

**Preventive Algae Control:**

**Glass Cleaning:**
- Clean front and side glass weekly using appropriate scrapers
- Remove algae spots before they establish
- Use magnetic cleaners for regular maintenance
- Keep glass cleaning tools dedicated to aquarium use only

**Hardscape Maintenance:**
- Brush stone and driftwood surfaces gently
- Remove thread algae manually using tweezers
- Clean equipment surfaces that show algae buildup
- Monitor and address algae hotspots promptly

**Biological Algae Control:**
- Maintain appropriate stocking levels of algae-eating species
- Ensure proper plant density to outcompete algae for nutrients
- Monitor and adjust lighting duration and intensity as needed

### Equipment Maintenance

**Filter System Care:**
- Clean filter impellers and housing monthly
- Rinse mechanical media in tank water (not tap water)
- Replace chemical media according to manufacturer recommendations
- Check all connections and seals for leaks

**CO2 System Maintenance:**
